      <p class="content-sub">Corin led a team of about 20 Vassar students in teaching local high school students how to code in association with Google. With this team, he developed the course content for a ten session, once per week overview of Python. The first five classes teach the basics of programming, while the next five each focus on a specific topic like Data Science or Blockchains. After learning the basics, students utilize and refine their skills by investigating one of these five topics further on their own. See <a href=https://stories.vassar.edu/2017/171207-teaching-kids-to-code.html><i>Teaching Kids to Code</i></a> for details of the Spring 2017 program!</p>

      <p class="content-sub">Building on the course content he developed for Google igniteCS, with the help of one other student and a Vassar computer science professor, Corin developed and helped teach a 6-week introductory course to computer science in Python, based on the Harvey Mudd CS for All course.
      This Harvey Mudd class became a 6-week, 6-hour a day course that covers computer science in as much detail as possible for 16 students with limited to no background in CS.
      This was a trial run of the course which may soon become a full for-credit course in the introductory sequence of the Vassar CS department.
      You can see the course content at <a href="https://cscamp.cs.vassar.edu/">https://cscamp.cs.vassar.edu/</a></p>

Corin's job was to make it user friendly!</p>
